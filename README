Bliss (BLiss IS SagaA) is a pragmatic and lightweight implementation of the OGF 
SAGA standard (GFD.90). Bliss is written 100% in Python and focuses on usability 
and easy deployment rather than on feature completeness.

Please refer to the Bliss wiki for installation instructions, user guide, etc:
