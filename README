Bliss (BLiss IS SagaA) is a pragmatic, 'laissez-faire' implementation of the 
OGF SAGA standard (GFD.90). Bliss is written 100% in Python and focuses on 
usability and ease of deployment rather than on feature completeness or blind 
standard obedience.

Please refer to the Bliss wiki for installation instructions, user guide, etc:
