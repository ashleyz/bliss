Bliss SSH Adaptor:

Issues:
- If you leave any running SSH connections open,
  Python will complain when the program terminates.
  (will be fixed in the future)

- Paramiko uses the same logging settings as SAGA_VERBOSE.
  This behaves as intended, but I can add code to specifically
  change the Paramiko logging if needed.
