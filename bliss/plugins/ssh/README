Bliss SSH Adaptor:

Issues:
- If you leave any running SSH connections open,
  Python will complain when the program terminates.
  (will be fixed in the future)

- Paramiko uses the same logging settings as SAGA_VERBOSE.
  I think this may be unintended behavior which may need
  to be changed in Bliss itself, will fix this when I can.
