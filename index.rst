Bliss, a SAGA implementation in Python
======================================

Bliss (\ **B**\ liss **IS** **S**\ AGA) is a pragmatic, light-weight
implementation of the OGF SAGA standard (GFD.90_). Bliss is written 100% in
Python and focuses on usability and ease of deployment rather than on feature
completeness or strict standard obedience.
